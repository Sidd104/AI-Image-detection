# AI-Image-detection

This project is a responsive, interactive web application that allows users to upload or drag-and-drop images and uses advanced AI to determine whether each image is real or AI-generated. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, the app handles image validation, Base64 conversion, and communicates with the Google Gemini AI API using robust retry logic. It features smooth animations, drag-and-drop support, loading indicators, and a custom modal for error messages, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience. Users receive a clear classification along with a detailed explanation highlighting visual artifacts, lighting patterns, and other AI-detection cues. The code manages object URLs efficiently, exposes global wrappers for button actions, and presents results with animated, color-coded feedback, making it a complete client-side solution for image authenticity verification.
